I was genuinely surprised when I found out that C++ now supports python style looping over dicts.  

Here is an example:  
´´´
std::map<char, int> a_dict{{'J', 25/\}/,{'P', 27/\}\}/;
for (const auto& [key, value] : a_dict) {
  std::cout << key << value << std::endl;
/\}/  
´´´  

C++ 17 has brought about so many new features and I am really excited to try them out.

Ideas? comments? suggestions for improvement?
