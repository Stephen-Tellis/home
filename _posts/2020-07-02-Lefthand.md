I recently came across a video where a you-tuber challenged herself to learn to write with her left hand. As a part of the challenge, she wrote 1 page a day with her left hand for 21 days.   
I thought this was a very nice idea and a great skill to have, which is why, I planned to try it myself. 
Here you will find the album with all the images.

The project is still underway and I will keep adding photos to the album as I write.

Ideas? comments? suggestions for improvement?
