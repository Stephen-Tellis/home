I recently came across a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YodRoWUOhc "Watch video") where a you-tuber challenged herself to learn to write with her weak hand. As a part of the challenge, she wrote 1 page a day with her left hand for 21 days.   
I thought this was a very nice idea and a great skill to have, which is why, I planned to try it myself. 
Here you will find the album with all the images of my progress.
