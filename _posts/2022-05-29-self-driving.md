Mobile Robots are really cool.   
You know what else is a Mobile Robot?  
Yes, Self-Driving cars.   

Having learnt SLAM and Computer Vision in the context of robotics, I thought to myself, "why not look into how a self driving car follows a path?". And, voila, in a few hours, I had my own virtual 2D simulator built up with pygame.  

Currently, I have the most simple (kinematic only) bicycle model implemented for use with the Pure-Pursuit and Stanley controllers. But, I am already working on a more elaborate MPC based control solution which I will update here when complete.
