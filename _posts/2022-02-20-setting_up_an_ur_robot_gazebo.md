The first thing you will need for this fun trial is ROS1 (Robot Operating System). If you do not have it yet, have a look at my other post where I have setup a simple bash script that will install ROS for you with a single command.



Now that we have control over the robot, we can use this workspace to build more complex and SUPER interesting packages out of it.
