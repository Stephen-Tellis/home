### WORK AND RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

Engineer - **Robert Bosch Engineering and Business Solutions Pvt.
Ltd** <span style="float: right; ">Sep 2017 - August 2019</span>  
As an engineer in the Filters team which handles the design and development of diesel and oil filters for OEMs, my duties not only included technical activities such as design, reverse engineering, tolerance stack-up, but also both customer and supplier interaction.  
Experience at Bosch has not only strengthened my engineering foundations but also provided me hands-on experience in a variety of process, quality, and problem analysis tools such as DRBFM, FMEA, Ishikawa diagram, 5Why, and the 8D model.  
 
Summer Research Fellow - **Multiphase Flow Simulation Laboratory, IISc, Bangalore** <span style="float: right; ">June – July 2016</span>  
I worked onGerris, ascript-based programforthesolution of PDEs describing fluid flow at the Multiphase flow simulation laboratory at IISc in an attempt to simulate the behavior of electrostatically charged droplets at the Rayleigh charge limit.  


### PROJECTS

**Team SAENIEks - SAE BAJA team of NIE** - Team Captain - NIE Mysore <span style="float: right; ">March 2016 – March 2017</span>  
Pellentesque euismod odio nec mollis rutrum. Nulla facilisi. In hac habitasse platea dictumst. Etiam facilisis velit velit, id dapibus lacus bibendum nec. Proin euismod tortor non nunc luctus, ut varius mauris tristique.  

**Team SAENIEks - SAE BAJA team of NIE** - Team member - NIE Mysore <span style="float: right; ">March 2015 – March 2016</span>  
The position demanded technical know-how of an All-Terrain Vehicle. In addition to performing some of the design calculations, I was tasked with CAD tools such as Solidworks and Lotus Shark where a complete virtual model of the system was made and then validated with Ansys before fabrication.  

**CFD analysis of conjugated heat transfer in microchannel heat sink** - Mini-Project - NIE Mysore <span style="float: right; ">February - June 2016</span>  
The work focused on numerical estimation of effect of orientation and fillet radius on the heat transfer rates in a micro-channel heat. Study was limited to single phase laminar flow  

**Automatic Gear Reduction for Motorbikes** - Bachelor Project - NIE Mysore <span style="float: right; ">July 2016 - July 2017</span>  
The main objective of this project was to automate the down-shifting of gears in a motorbike bike with manual transmission with the goal of easing the driving experience and to provide maximum mileage. Working prototype was made and demonstrated.  


### INDUSTRY INTERNSHIPS AND CERTIFICATIONS

Intern - **Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd.** <span style="float: right; ">December 2015 – January 2016</span>  
An internship centred on maintenance and repair of mechanical components in large industries.  

Intern - **Mandovi Motors Pvt. Ltd.** <span style="float: right; ">July 2015 – 10 Days</span>
