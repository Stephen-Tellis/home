### WORK AND RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

1. `Intern, Master Student` - **BMW AG**<span style="float: right; ">October 2020 - Present</span>  
Development of a vision-based quality assessment robotic platform for co-working environments
- Design and implementation of a co-working algorithm
- Smart re-planning and collision avoidance using Point Cloud and Laser Scan data
- X-in-Loop testing and deployment

2. `Student Assistant` - **Individualized Production in Architecture - RWTH
Aachen University**<span style="float: right; ">October 2020 - Present</span>  
Assisted researchers at the Institute in completing industry projects.  
The projects included:
- Setting up IoT network of sensors for inventory and localization of building material in construction zones
- Path-planning ofMobile robotswith ROS for automated construction applications

3. `Mechanical Engineer` - **Robert Bosch Engineering and Business Solutions Pvt.
Ltd** <span style="float: right; ">Sep 2017 - August 2019</span>  
Engineer in the 'Filters' team responsible for the design and development of diesel and oil filters for commercial vehile OEMs:   
- Engaged in technical activities such as design of plastic and sheet metal components, reverse engineering.   
- Tasked with complete project responsibilities including customer and supplier interaction.  
Experience at Bosch has not only strengthened my engineering foundations but also provided me hands-on experience in a variety of process, quality, and problem analysis tools such as DRBFM, FMEA, Ishikawa diagram, 5Why, and the 8D model.  


4. `Summer Research Fellow` - **Multiphase Flow Simulation Laboratory, IISc, Bangalore** <span style="float: right; ">June – July 2016</span>  
As a reserch fellow, I was attempting to simulate the behavior of electrostatically charged droplets at the Rayleigh charge limit.  
- Worked on Gerris, a script-based programming language.

<br />
### PROJECTS

1. **Team SAENIEks - SAE BAJA team of NIE** - `Project Manager` <span style="float: right; ">March 2016 – March 2017</span>    
- Captain of a 25 member cross-functional team
- Tasks including securing and coordinating sponsorships, team logistics and resource management
The hurdles faced in this position clearly expanded my horizons and gave me a perspective of the world from a managers shoes.

2. **Team SAENIEks - SAE BAJA team of NIE** - `Team member` <span style="float: right; ">March 2015 – March 2016</span>  
- Design of Roll Cage and Suspension components
- FEA analysis of components 
The position demanded technical know-how of an All-Terrain Vehicle. 

3. **CFD analysis of conjugated heat transfer in microchannel heat sink** - `Mini-Project` <span style="float: right; ">February - June 2016</span>  
The work focused on numerical estimation of effect of orientation and fillet radius on the heat transfer rates in a micro-channel heat. Study conducted with Ansys and limited to single phase laminar flow.  

4. **Automatic Gear Reduction for Motorbikes** - `Bachelor Project` <span style="float: right; ">July 2016 - July 2017</span>  
The main objective of this project was to automate the down-shifting of gears in a motorbike bike with manual transmission. The automation resulted in easing the drivability and improved mileage. 
- A working prototype was made and demonstrated as a team of four  
- Experience with microcontroller programming and control systems
- Indigenously developed algorithm
