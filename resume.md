### WORK AND RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

1. Mechanical Engineer - **Robert Bosch Engineering and Business Solutions Pvt.
Ltd** <span style="float: right; ">Sep 2017 - August 2019</span>  
_As an engineer in the Filters team handling the design and development of diesel and oil filters for commercial vehile OEMs:_   
- _Engaged in technical activities such as design of plastic and sheet metal components, reverse engineering._   
- _Tasked with complete project responsibilities including customer and supplier interaction._  
_Experience at Bosch has not only strengthened my engineering foundations but also provided me hands-on experience in a variety of process, quality, and problem analysis tools such as DRBFM, FMEA, Ishikawa diagram, 5Why, and the 8D model._  

 
2. Summer Research Fellow - **Multiphase Flow Simulation Laboratory, IISc, Bangalore** <span style="float: right; ">June – July 2016</span>  
_As a reserch fellow, I was attempting to simulate the behavior of electrostatically charged droplets at the Rayleigh charge limit._  
- _Worked on Gerris, a script-based programming language._


### PROJECTS

1. **Team SAENIEks - SAE BAJA team of NIE** - Project Manager - NIE Mysore <span style="float: right; ">March 2016 – March 2017</span>    
- _Put together an extremely talented team of 25 budding engineers to compete in the SAE Baja-India competition._
- _Tasks including constant interaction with local businesses to secure sponsorships for the project, presentations to the college board, and team logistics management._
_The hurdles faced in this position clearly expanded my horizons and gave me a perspective of the world from a managers shoes._

2. **Team SAENIEks - SAE BAJA team of NIE** - Team member - NIE Mysore <span style="float: right; ">March 2015 – March 2016</span>  
_The position demanded technical know-how of an All-Terrain Vehicle._
