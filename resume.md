### WORK AND RESEARCH EXPERIENCE


1. `Student Assistant` - **Individualized Production in Architecture - RWTH
Aachen University**<span style="float: right; ">October 2020 - Present</span>
Assisted researchers at the Institute in completing industry projects.  
The projects included:
- IoT integration of RFID sensors for automated construction application. Prototype was created with a webapp interface for data monitoring and database management.
- GPS localization of construction equipment at an automated construction site - currently ongoing

2. `Mechanical Engineer` - **Robert Bosch Engineering and Business Solutions Pvt.
Ltd** <span style="float: right; ">Sep 2017 - August 2019</span>  
Engineer in the 'Filters' team responsible for the design and development of diesel and oil filters for commercial vehile OEMs:   
- Engaged in technical activities such as design of plastic and sheet metal components, reverse engineering.   
- Tasked with complete project responsibilities including customer and supplier interaction.  
Experience at Bosch has not only strengthened my engineering foundations but also provided me hands-on experience in a variety of process, quality, and problem analysis tools such as DRBFM, FMEA, Ishikawa diagram, 5Why, and the 8D model.  


2. `Summer Research Fellow` - **Multiphase Flow Simulation Laboratory, IISc, Bangalore** <span style="float: right; ">June – July 2016</span>  
As a reserch fellow, I was attempting to simulate the behavior of electrostatically charged droplets at the Rayleigh charge limit.  
- Worked on Gerris, a script-based programming language.

<br />
### PROJECTS

1. **Team SAENIEks - SAE BAJA team of NIE** - `Project Manager` <span style="float: right; ">March 2016 – March 2017</span>    
- Put together an extremely talented team of 25 budding engineers to compete in the SAE Baja-India competition.
- Tasks including constant interaction with local businesses to secure sponsorships for the project, presentations to the college board, and team logistics management.
The hurdles faced in this position clearly expanded my horizons and gave me a perspective of the world from a managers shoes.

2. **Team SAENIEks - SAE BAJA team of NIE** - `Team member` <span style="float: right; ">March 2015 – March 2016</span>  
The position demanded technical know-how of an All-Terrain Vehicle. 
- Tasked with CAD on Solidworks - a complete virtual model of the system generated for numerical validation before fabrication.  

3. **CFD analysis of conjugated heat transfer in microchannel heat sink** - `Mini-Project` <span style="float: right; ">February - June 2016</span>  
The work focused on numerical estimation of effect of orientation and fillet radius on the heat transfer rates in a micro-channel heat. Study conducted with Ansys and limited to single phase laminar flow.  

4. **Automatic Gear Reduction for Motorbikes** - `Bachelor Project` <span style="float: right; ">July 2016 - July 2017</span>  
The main objective of this project was to automate the down-shifting of gears in a motorbike bike with manual transmission. The automation resulted in easing the drivability and improved mileage. 
- A working prototype was made and demonstrated as a team of four.  
- Experience with electronics and controls with use of Hall sensors, Arduino Uno, Linear Actuators.
- Indigenously developed algorithm.

<br />
### INDUSTRY INTERNSHIPS AND CERTIFICATIONS
